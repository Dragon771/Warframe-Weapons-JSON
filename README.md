# GenesisJSON
JSON files that relate to the Genesis discord bot.

All of the information in the JSON files when they are first added is from the warframe wiki weapon comparison list. But unfortunatly that list does not contail all of the information we need, and it is not updated super regualrly so we will need to add new weapons in as they come.

some of the fields that are not include in the weapons comparison list are: "url" (url to the weapon in warframe market), "subtype" (sniper, shotgun, whip, dagger etc), "flight" (Flight speed guns only), "noise"(guns only), "ammo" (ammo max guns only), "riven_disposition" (does not include archwing weapons), "thumbnail" (small image of weapon), and "location" (Where you can get the weapon bp).
